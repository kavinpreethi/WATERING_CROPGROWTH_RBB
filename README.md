WATERING_CROPGROWTH_RBB is a sub-model of the WATER user associations at the Interface of Nexus Governance (WATERING) model (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-nqs9ak2nY). WATERING allows exploring the impact of community-based water governance on water availability, water use and economic productivity within an irrigation scheme.
